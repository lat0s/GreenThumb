## Scope



## Challenges and lessons learned

1. **Understanding traceability**: By making sure that requirements and issues were accurately mapped and recorded, we learnt the significance of traceability for effective project management and workflow
2. **Effectively using Git**: We had issues formatting wiki pages, establishing tags and labels, and managing documentation when using Git for project management. We learned to distinguish between material for the wiki (in-depth documentation, tutorials, sprint summaries) and the README file (project summary, installation, and usage).
3. **Structuring the project**: We learned the significance of a well-organized project structure for efficient collaboration, we achieved this by assigning different tasks to different team members to create a more cohesive and structured work-flow.
4. **Integrating sensors with the Wio terminal**: Integrating Grove sensors with the WIO Seed Terminal was a challenging task for us due to no prior experience with the hardware.



## Learning outcomes

The team successfully utilized ideas from the course, including Git workflow for collaboration, requirements tracing for project management, and documentation for clarity, during Sprint #1. Additionally, we started learning and coding the MQTT to be able to communicate real-time data and the Arduino IDE to program the Wio Seed Terminal to display the readings recieved from the grove and built-in sensors.
